So this update focuses on ironing out a few key bugs from previous updates, as well as adding some QOL additions and changes. Chiefly amoung them, I decided that Mynock needed some love so threw together some Star Wars varients of vanilla *gasp* vehicles.

    + ##### Vehicle Fixes
        +  Warden Tank now has a commander seat once more
        +  CIS Aircraft no longer shoot backwards! (Mishandeling them in zeus will still cause this to happen!)
        +  CIS Aircraft now do 6 times more damage, this is a return to their correct value from before they started shooting backwards.
        + LAAT/C Carry script now works again (Please use this instead of Mynock manually loading themselves to prevent issues with the flight model)
    + #### Vehicle Changes
        +  I've come up with some *great* names for the shit we made in the past, like the coaxium cannon and the... the eh... okay well anyway I've also came up with some *terrible* names, I seek to rectify that with the following changes:
            +  HOT - Renamed to Trebuchet
            +  ROT - Renamed to Catapult
            +  FIT - Renamed to Pathfinder
            +  LIT - Renamed to Tempest
            +  LIT Mk.2 - Renamed to Trojan
        +  Mounted MG's on vics can now shoot straight. (This includes the CIS Trojan)
        +  Bantha now has x2 TOW missiles
        +  LAAT‚Äôs have had smoke launchers moved to the back of the line for default countermeasures
        +  LAAT Primary Dual Cannon has had its damage increased slightly
        +  The Tyrant and Overlord AA turrets had stopped working, attempting to use them resulted in a CTD. They have been removed while I work on new versions.
