**Luke Skywalker** - "This missile spam is *fuckin* borin mate"

As the name suggests the main focus of this update was improving the gameplay in the skies, Star Wars dogfights took *obvious* inspiration from the white knuckle engagements of WWII, and with that in mind I, Zatama,  have made various additions and changes in an attempt to capture the *ascetic* and *excitement* of space (Air) battles in the star wars universe. Here are the changes specific to that goal ;)
